#### Exercise 1
1. A condition for LU decomposition is that all submatrices in $A$ are non-singular. The 1x1 submatrix in the upper-left corner is [0], which has a determinant of 0. Hence it is singular.
> In linear algebra, the leading principal minors of a square matrix are the determinants of its upper-left submatrices

2. Only if all the diagonal components $U_{i,i}$ are non-zero

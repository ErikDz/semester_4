### Exercises

#### Exercise 1
We have that $A=LU = \begin{bmatrix}
L_{1,1}U_{1,1} & L_{1,2}U_{2,1}\\
L_{2,1}U_{1,1} & L_{2,2}U_{2,2}
\end{bmatrix}$
Hence, we have that $L_{1,1}U_{1,1}=0\implies L_{1,1}\text{ or } U_{1,1} = 0$ which is a contradiction

- **Def - symmetric matrix:** In linear algebra, a matrix is said to be symmetric if it is equal to its own transpose.
- The transpose of a product of matrices is given by the reverse product of their transposes, in reverse order. That is:
$$(AB)^T = B^T A^T$$

- **Def - positive matrix:** we can say that a matrix $B$ is positive if $V^TBV\geq 0$ for all $V\in\mathbb{R}^N$.


- **Def - definite:** All eigenvalues have the same sign (means that determinant is not 0)

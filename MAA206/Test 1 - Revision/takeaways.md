#### Exercise 1
For $\mathbb{K}$-linear, since it's $E\rightarrow\mathbb{K}$, to prove that something is $\mathbb{K}$-linear, the constant we choose $\lambda$ should be in $\mathbb{K}$

#### Exercise 10
When we have a basis that resembles a poly, to prove l.i., derive and set x to be something that will give zero like that you show that $\lambda_i=0$

3. In a general vector space $E$ of dimension $n$, any vector $x$ decomposes as
$$x=\sum_{i=1}^ne_i^*(x)e_i$$
